## Cloning Your Fork

## Creating Commit Messages

We use commitizen with gitmoji for standardized commit messages. To generate a proper commit message in Cursor IDE:

a. In the Cursor AI chat:

- Type `@` and select "PR (Diff with Main Branch)"
- Type `@` again and select "commit.ai"
- Press Enter

The AI will generate a properly formatted commit message based on your changes.

b. Use the generated message with git commit:

```bash
git commit -m "ðŸ“š docs: add new feature documentation"
```

Note: This commit message workflow is designed for use with Cursor IDE and its integrated AI assistant.

## Writing Markdown Files

We use md.ai to ensure consistent markdown formatting across the project. To validate your markdown files in Cursor IDE:

a. In the Cursor AI chat:

- Type `@` and select "md.ai"
- Press Enter

The AI will check your markdown against the project's `.markdownlint.jsonc` rules and suggest any necessary formatting corrections.
