## Introduction

The Human-Machine Network (HMN) is a sophisticated decentralized governance system that leverages artificial
intelligence, blockchain technology, and human expertise to create a robust, scalable, and fair decision-making
platform. HMN aims to address the challenges of traditional governance systems by providing a transparent, efficient,
and adaptable framework for community-driven decision-making.

For a comprehensive overview of the HMN framework, please refer to our [Executive Summary](docs/00_Executive_Summary.md).

## Key Features

- Decentralized Decision-Making
- AI-Assisted Governance
- Polycentric Governance Structure
- Smart Agent Economy
- Verifiable AI Inference
- Blockchain-based Transparency and Immutability
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Privacy
- Cross-Chain Interoperability
