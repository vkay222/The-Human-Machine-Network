# Topic Submission and Prioritization

![Topic Submission and Prioritization](./imgs/topic_submission_and_prioritization.png)

## Overview

The Topic Submission and Prioritization phase is the initial stage of the community governance process.
It allows members or their personal AI agents to submit topics of interest, which are then organized and
prioritized by an AI moderator. Each topic includes a scope of impact, detailing which entities would be
affected by the proposed changes.

For information on the different levels of participation in the HMN, please refer to the
[Polycentric Governance Levels](./Polycentric_Governance_Levels.md) document.

## Process Steps

1. **Topic Submission**

   - A community member or their personal AI agent submits a topic.
   - The topic includes a title, description, relevant tags, and scope of impact.
   - The scope of impact specifies which entities (from the list above) would be affected by the topic.

2. **Initial Placement**

   - The submitted topic is automatically added to the topic list, initially placed at the bottom.
   - The topic's visibility is set based on its scope of impact.

3. **AI Moderation**

   - An AI moderator analyzes the new topic.
   - The AI verifies the appropriateness of the specified scope of impact.
   - If similar topics exist, the AI groups the new topic with them.

4. **User Interaction**

   - The user can edit their submitted topic at any time, including adjusting the scope of impact.
   - If the topic was grouped, the user can contest the grouping.
   - Users can view and engage with topics that fall within their domains of participation.

5. **AI Review**

   - The AI moderator reviews any edits, scope changes, or grouping contestations.
   - The AI decides whether to accept or deny the changes.

6. **Topic List Update**
   - The topic list is continuously updated based on new submissions, edits, and AI moderation decisions.
   - Topics are organized and displayed according to their scope of impact and relevance to users' domains of participation.

## Key Features

- **Open Submission**: Any community member or their AI agent can submit topics at any time.
- **Automatic Listing**: All submitted topics are added to the list, ensuring every idea is captured.
- **Intelligent Grouping**: Similar topics are grouped to prevent duplication and enhance discussion.
- **Scope of Impact**: Each topic clearly defines which entities would be affected by its implementation.
- **User Control**: Submitters can edit their topics, adjust scope, and contest AI grouping decisions.
- **AI Moderation**: An AI moderator manages grouping, reviews user edits, and verifies scope of impact for
  consistency and relevance.
- **Domain-based Visibility**: Users see topics relevant to their domains of participation, promoting focused engagement.

## Challenges and Mitigations

- **Spam Prevention**: Implement rate limiting and user reputation systems to prevent abuse.
- **Grouping Accuracy**: Continuously train the AI moderator to improve topic similarity detection and scope verification.
- **User Disagreements**: Provide a clear process for users to contest AI decisions, with potential for human moderator
  intervention in complex cases.
- **Scope Creep**: Regularly audit and review topic scopes to ensure they remain accurate and relevant.

This process ensures that all community ideas are captured while maintaining an organized and efficient topic list.
The combination of AI moderation, user input, and scope-based organization creates a balanced system for managing
community-generated content across various domains of impact.
