## Overview

The Proposal Phase is a crucial stage in the HMN governance process where top-ranked topics are developed into
detailed solution proposals. This phase encourages collaborative input from community members and leverages AI
assistance to create comprehensive and well-structured proposals.

## Process Steps

1. **Initiation**

   - Top-ranked topics from the Topic Submission and Prioritization phase enter the Proposal Phase.
   - A 7-day window is opened for solution proposals.

2. **Expert Notification**

   - Experts in relevant fields are automatically notified about the topics.
   - This ensures that individuals with domain knowledge can contribute to proposal development.

3. **AI-Assisted Drafting**

   - AI agents help draft and refine proposals.
   - They provide structure, suggest relevant data points, and ensure completeness.

4. **Collaborative Editing**

   - Community members can use collaborative editing tools to contribute to proposals.
   - This allows for diverse perspectives and collective intelligence in proposal development.

5. **Proposal Templating**

   - Standardized proposal templates are used to ensure consistency and completeness.
   - Templates include sections for objectives, implementation plans, resource requirements, and expected outcomes.

6. **Impact Assessment**

   - Automated impact assessments are conducted for each proposal.
   - This includes financial, social, and environmental impact analyses.

7. **Data Integration**
   - Relevant external data sources are integrated into proposals.
   - This ensures that proposals are based on up-to-date and comprehensive information.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Development**: Encourages community-wide participation in proposal creation.
- **AI Assistance**: Leverages AI for proposal drafting, refinement, and impact assessment.
- **Standardization**: Uses templates to ensure consistent and complete proposal structures.
- **Expert Involvement**: Automatically engages domain experts in relevant proposals.
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Integrates external data sources for informed decision-making.

## Challenges and Mitigations

- **Information Overload**: AI agents summarize and highlight key points to manage complexity.
- **Balancing Perspectives**: Ensure diverse viewpoints are represented in each proposal.
- **Quality Control**: Implement peer review processes and AI-driven quality checks.

This phase transforms high-priority topics into well-structured, comprehensive proposals ready for community voting
and potential implementation.
