# Glossary of Terms for the Human-Machine Network (HMN)

## A

### AI Agent

An autonomous software entity within the HMN that uses artificial intelligence to perform tasks and make decisions.

### AI Agent Collective

A group of specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems within the HMN.

## B

### Blockchain

A decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers.

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

A property of a system that can resist the class of failures derived from the Byzantine Generals' Problem.

## C

### Consensus Mechanism

The process by which a network of nodes comes to agreement on the state of a blockchain.

### Cross-Chain Interoperability

The ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and share data with each other.

## D

### Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by shareholders,
and not influenced by a central government.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Financial services built on blockchain technologies that operate without centralized intermediaries.

## E

### Explainable AI (XAI)

AI systems that make their decisions understandable to humans.

## F

### Federated Learning

A machine learning technique that trains algorithms across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local
data samples, without exchanging them.

## G

### Governance Token

A cryptocurrency that represents voting power in a blockchain-based project.

## H

### Human-Machine Network (HMN)

A decentralized governance system that integrates human expertise with AI and blockchain technologies.

## I

### Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

A protocol that enables communication between different blockchain networks.

## L

### Liquid Democracy

A form of delegative democracy where voters can either vote directly or delegate their voting power to representatives.

## M

### Mirror Objects

On-chain representations of off-chain AI resources in the HMN.

### Multi-Agent System (MAS)

A computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment.

## P

### Polycentric Governance

A governance system characterized by multiple centers of decision-making that are formally independent of each other.

## Q

### Quadratic Voting

A collective decision-making procedure where participants express the degree of their preferences.

## S

### Smart Contract

Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

### Smart Agent Economy

An economic system within the HMN where AI agents can own and trade resources.

## T

### Tokenomics

The study of the economics of cryptocurrency tokens.

## V

### Verifiable AI Inference

The process of validating the outputs and decision-making processes of AI systems in a transparent manner.

## Z

### Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

A method by which one party can prove to another party that they know a value x, without conveying any information
apart from the fact that they know the value x.

### zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine)

A virtual machine that can execute computations and generate zero-knowledge proofs of their correct execution.
