## Introduction

The Human-Machine Network (HMN) is a decentralized governance system that leverages artificial intelligence, blockchain
technology, and human expertise to create a robust, scalable, and fair decision-making platform. HMN aims to address the
challenges of traditional governance systems by providing a transparent, efficient, and adaptable framework for
community-driven decision-making.

and Swarm Intelligence -->

## Blockchain and Tokenomics

<!-- TODO: Create an infographic illustrating the tokenomics of the HMN, including the native token (HMNX) and its various
 uses -->

## Security and Privacy

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Ensure privacy in voting and sensitive computations.
- Decentralized Identity: Self-sovereign identity management for users and AI agents.
- Encrypted Storage: Sensitive data stored off-chain with on-chain verification.
- Trusted Execution Environments: Secure execution of sensitive AI models.

## Future Directions

- Quantum-Resistant Cryptography: Preparing for post-quantum security challenges.
- Advanced AI Ethics: Developing more sophisticated frameworks for AI governance and ethics.
- Interoperable AI Standards: Working towards global standards for AI resource representation and exchange.
- Federated Learning: Enabling collaborative AI model training while preserving data privacy.

The Human-Machine Network represents a pioneering approach to decentralized governance, combining the strengths of human
intelligence, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to create a more efficient, transparent, and adaptable
decision-making system for communities of all sizes.
