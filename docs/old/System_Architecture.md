## Introduction

The Human-Machine Network (HMN) is a sophisticated system that combines artificial intelligence, blockchain technology,
and human expertise to create a decentralized, transparent, and efficient governance platform. This document provides a
high-level overview of the HMN system architecture, detailing how various components interact to form a cohesive and
powerful decision-making ecosystem.

## System Overview

The HMN is designed as a multi-layered, modular system that leverages the strengths of both human intelligence and
machine capabilities. It incorporates advanced concepts from various blockchain and AI projects, including Theoriq,
Talus, and Autonolas, to create a robust and flexible governance platform.

 within the HMN -->

## Core Components

1. **Personal AI Agents**: Intelligent assistants representing individual users.
2. **AI Agent Collectives**: Structured groups of specialized AI agents for complex tasks.
3. **Blockchain Layer**: Ensures transparency, immutability, and decentralization.
4. **Modular DAO Layer**: Implements governance logic and decision-making workflows.
5. **Mirror Objects**: On-chain representations of off-chain AI resources.
6. **Smart Agent Economy**: A marketplace for AI resources and services.
7. **Decentralized Storage**: Ensures data sovereignty and resilience.
8. **Tokenomics System**: Drives participation and aligns incentives.

 interactions -->

## Layered Architecture

The HMN system is structured into three main layers:

1. **Human Input Layer**:

   - Collects and processes inputs from human participants.
   - Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving input collection.

2. **Modular DAO Layer**:

   - Implements governance logic and manages decision-making workflows.
   - Supports liquid democracy and quadratic voting mechanisms.
   - Integrates with blockchain for transparent and immutable record-keeping.

3. **Execution Layer**:
   - Utilizes AI agents and collectives to implement governance decisions.
   - Manages resources and executes tasks based on DAO decisions.

layers interact -->

## Integration of AI and Blockchain

The HMN seamlessly integrates AI and blockchain technologies:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Implement governance rules, voting mechanisms, and reputation systems.
2. **Verifiable AI Inference**: Ensures transparency and trust in AI-driven decisions.
3. **On-chain Resource Representation**: Uses Mirror Objects to represent AI models, data, and computation resources.
4. **Cross-Chain Communication**: Leverages IBC for interoperability with other blockchain networks.

## Data Flow and Interoperability

1. **Inter-Component Communication**:

   - Message queue systems for real-time updates between components.
   - GraphQL API for efficient data querying across the system.

2. **Blockchain Integration**:

   - AI agents interact with the blockchain through secure API calls.
   - ZK-proofs ensure privacy-preserving transactions.

3. **Decentralized Storage**:
   - IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave for different storage needs.
   - Content hashes stored on-chain for verification.

systems -->

## Mirror Objects and Smart Agent Economy

Incorporating concepts from Talus:

1. **Mirror Objects**:

   - Implement on-chain representations of off-chain AI resources (models, data, computation).
   - Develop smart contracts for managing ownership, access rights, and trading of Mirror Objects.

2. **Resource Marketplace**:

   - Create a decentralized marketplace for trading computational resources, AI models, and data.
   - Implement dynamic pricing mechanisms based on supply and demand.

3. **Cross-Chain Integration**:
   - Utilize IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) for interoperability with other networks.
   - Implement cross-chain asset transfer and governance mechanisms.

<!-- TODO: Design a diagram illustrating the concept of Mirror Objects and how they enable the Smart Agent Economy within
 the HMN -->

## Verifiable AI Inference

To enhance transparency and trust in AI-driven decisions:

1. **Digital Signatures**: For quick verification of routine AI outputs.
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: For privacy-preserving verification of complex computations.
3. **Optimistic Fraud Proofs**: For cost-effective verification of large-scale computations.
4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining multiple verification methods based on specific requirements.

This enhanced architecture integrates autonomous services, smart agent economy, and verifiable AI inference into the
existing HMN framework. It provides a more robust, interoperable, and efficient ecosystem for decentralized governance,
leveraging the strengths of both human intelligence and advanced AI capabilities.
